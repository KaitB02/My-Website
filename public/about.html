        <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead fs-4">I enjoy having Europe and other close neighbouring countries on my doorstep for plenty of easy travel opportunites, whether it be for warm beach getways, music festivals or a wholesome hike, getting stuck in nature.
          I also enjoy keeping fit by playing a bit of social hockey league as well as playing some tennis or bouldering/rock climbing with the boyfriend. 
          Other hobbies would include cooking and baking (you could say im a bit of a foodie) and having some downtime watching movies and TV series.

        <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead fs-4">I am currently employed as a Membership Co-ordinator for a membership organisation. 
          I have been in this field of work for around 6 years and feel it is time to now venture out into something new and different.
